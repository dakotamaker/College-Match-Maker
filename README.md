A simple React Web Application to match students with their best college fits based off of their own answers in a survey and 
data from the U.S. Department of education. Data populated in a DB by [this script](https://github.com/dakotamaker/college-data-collector). App available [here](https://collegematchmaker.co/).

## Disclaimer
